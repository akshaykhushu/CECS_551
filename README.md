# Image-Classification

This code classifies the images into classes depending on the test images.

The code expects the data to be in the folder by the name of "dataNew". Inside this folder there should be "train" folder as well as a "test" folder. One can also have a "validation" folder as well. Every class should have its own folder with images inside "train", "test" and "validation" folder. 

Once it is done. You can run the code.
